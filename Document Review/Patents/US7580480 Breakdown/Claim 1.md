A soft decision method for demodulating a received signal **α+βi** of a square Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) consisting of an in-phase signal component and a quadrature phase signal component, comprising:

- Receiving the signal α+βi in a radio communication apparatus;

- Obtaining a plurality of conditional probability vector values, each being a soft decision value corresponding to a bit position of a hard decision, using a function including a conditional determination operation from the quadrature phase component and the in-phase component of the received signal,

- Wherein a conditional probability vector decision method for demodulating a first half of a total number of bits is the same as a decision method for demodulating the remaining half of the bits, and is determined by substituting a quadrature phase component value and an in-phase component value with each other, and

- Wherein the demodulation method of the conditional probability vector corresponding to an odd-ordered bit is the same as a calculation method of the conditional probability vector corresponding to the next even-ordered bit, where the received signal value used to calculate the conditional probability vector corresponding to the odd-ordered bit uses one of the **α** and **β** according to a given combination constellation diagram and the received signal value for the even-ordered bit uses the remaining one of **α** and **β**.
